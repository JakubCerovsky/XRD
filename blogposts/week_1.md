# 1st Week Post

During the first lecture we were introduced to the concept of the classes, and shared our expectations. We have seen the course roadmap, projects related to XR, and received the list of expectations coming from the teacher (or as he called himself, the facilitator).

## Introduction to Extended Reality

#### What is AR/VR/AV/MR/XR and how do the terminologies compare?

Extended Reality (XR) is a superset of multiple terminologies:

**Augmented Reality (AR)**

- **Virtual Reality (VR)**

- **Augmented Virtuality (AV)**

- **Mixed Reality**

-

#### How do XR applications compare to traditional desktop and mobile applications?

Extended Reality adds the immersive feeling of interactions where our presence actually matters, and are not just bound to buttons.

#### What use cases does XR have?

XR can benefit us in many different use cases, due to its flexibility and potential to simulate real life use cases while minimizing downsides. <br>
Examples of this can be found in the following areas:

- Gaming: 
```
Immersive worlds that give the player a more natural way to interact with its surroundings. 
```
- Media & Events: 
```
Movies, Immersive storytelling, virtual concerts or even a shared place for people to interact (like VRChat). 
```
- Education & Training:
```
Simulations can provide a good idea of how real life machines/concepts are applied, while also providing a safe environment that minimizes the risk of the "real thing" and gives the user the opportunity to retry. These can have the added benefit of unsupervised learning that allows the teaching to happen at the learners own pace, while providing all of the materials needed. Some examples could include the use of complex machinery or medical procedures.
```
- Marketing & Retail: 
```
AR applications could be used to show the user how certain products would look in their home, or VR could be used to take the user and place him in a world that simulates a product he is considering buying (cars, homes, etc).
```
- Remote help 
- Product Development & Art (ex Blender)
- Virtual tourism
- Architecture & Construction

#### How does XR add value to the end user?
XR has a few key elements that give value to the end user:

- Risk reduction (simulated environments usually have less consequences)
- Intuitive and interactive learning environment that can encourage a hands-on approach to learning
- Convenience & Accessibility (for some high stakes processes or in cases where the tools/resources are limited)
- Efficiency & Structure (instructions can be displayed in/next to the area of interest)
- Entertainment

#### How does current XR technology compare to an idealistic future vision of the technology?

#### How does immersion and presence factor into XR?

#### How is input technology and interactions different in XR?

#### What problems can XR solve?

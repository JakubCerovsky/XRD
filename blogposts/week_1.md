# 1st Week Post

During the first lecture we were introduced to the concept of the classes, and shared our expectations. We have seen the course roadmap, projects related to XR, and received the list of expectations coming from the teacher (or as he called himself, the facilitator).

## Introduction to Extended Reality

#### What is AR/VR/AV/MR/XR and how do the terminologies compare?

Extended Reality (XR) is a superset of multiple terminologies:

**Augmented Reality (AR)**

- **Virtual Reality (VR)**

- **Augmented Virtuality (AV)**

- **Mixed Reality**

-

#### How do XR applications compare to traditional desktop and mobile applications?

Extended Reality adds the immersive feeling of interactions where our presence actually matters, and are not just bound to buttons.

#### What use cases does XR have?

The presence and immersion can serve as an opportunity for training purposes or some scenario simulations. This can be benefitial for safety reasons, or just as an increase in productivity.

#### How does XR add value to the end user?

#### How does current XR technology compare to an idealistic future vision of the technology?

#### How does immersion and presence factor into XR?

#### How is input technology and interactions different in XR?

In a traditional virtual medium, inputs are abstracted into buttons, joysticks, keyboards, mice, or touchscreens. Complex actions like walking, opening a door, or eating can be reduced to a single button press or gesture. The physical motion is minimal as the computer interprets symbolic inputs. This breaks the immersion of interaction.

Thats why input technology in XR is trying to be as close to the real thing. As an example in the game minecraft to eat you press and hold a button and it just kind of happens. Meanwhile in the VR version of the same game its much more high fidelity as to eat you have to pick up food with hand tracking, moving it toward your face, triggering a “bite”.

#### What problems can XR solve?

Besides offering more diverse entertainment, XR can solve diverse real-world problems.

It enables safer and more effective training in fields such as healthcare, aviation, and manufacturing by simulating complex or hazardous environments without real-world risks.

In education, XR creates immersive classrooms where students can explore abstract concepts or historical events as if they were physically present. And it can also make reading more interesting by overlaying a replica of what the person is studying about.

It also enhances remote collaboration, allowing people in different parts of the world to interact with 3D content in shared virtual spaces. Think of having a very good oil engineer across the world guide you hot to fix the oil rig.

In healthcare, XR supports therapy, rehabilitation, and pain management through controlled, engaging environments.
Additionally, it improves accessibility by offering virtual mobility options and adaptive interfaces for people with disabilities. Beyond this, XR helps architects, engineers, and designers rapidly prototype and visualize projects before physical production, saving both time and cost. Truly the posibilities are endless...

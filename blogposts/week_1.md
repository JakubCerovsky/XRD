# 1st Week Post

During the first lecture we were introduced to the concept of the classes, and shared our expectations. We have seen the course roadmap, projects related to XR, and received the list of expectations coming from the teacher (or as he called himself, the facilitator).

## Introduction to Extended Reality

### What is AR/VR/AV/MR/XR and how do the terminologies compare?

Extended Reality (XR) is a superset of multiple terminologies:

**Augmented Reality (AR)**

AR projects digital things onto a real world environment.

**Virtual Reality (VR)**

Users are immersed within completely virtual environment. It is fully dettached from the physical world unlike other realities.

**Augmented Virtuality (AV)**

It does basically the opposite of the AR. It digitalizes a physical object into a virtual environment.

**Mixed Reality (MR)**

Mixed Reality is a concept which combines all of the realities together. User can experience an integration of both realities.

### How do XR applications compare to traditional desktop and mobile applications?

XR adds the immersive feeling of interactions where our presence actually matters, and are not just bound to 2D screens.

|                   | **XR Applications**                                                                  | **Traditional Applications**                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concept**       | The way it allows users to engage provides them with a realistic form of experience. | Users may lack the feeling of immersion coming from the indirect experience. |
| **Advantages**    | + Improves productivity                                                              | + Accessible on (mostly) all devices                                         |
|                   | + Schooling and Training                                                             | + Developers have years of experience                                        |
|                   | + Visualization                                                                      | + Cheap                                                                      |
| **Disadvantages** | - Hardware Limitations                                                               | - Lacks sense of scale                                                       |
|                   | - Lack of content                                                                    | - Less intuitive                                                             |
|                   | - Expensive                                                                          |                                                                              |

#### What use cases does XR have?

The presence and immersion can serve as an opportunity for training purposes or some scenario simulations. This can be benefitial for safety reasons, or just as an increase in productivity.

#### How does XR add value to the end user?

#### How does current XR technology compare to an idealistic future vision of the technology?

#### How does immersion and presence factor into XR?

#### How is input technology and interactions different in XR?

#### What problems can XR solve?

# 1st Week Post

During the first lecture we were introduced to the concept of the classes, and shared our expectations. We have seen the course roadmap, projects related to XR, and received the list of expectations coming from the teacher (or as he called himself, the facilitator).

## Introduction to Extended Reality

### What is AR/VR/AV/MR/XR and how do the terminologies compare?

Extended Reality (XR) is a superset of multiple terminologies:

**Augmented Reality (AR)**

- **Virtual Reality (VR)**

- **Augmented Virtuality (AV)**

- **Mixed Reality**

-

### How do XR applications compare to traditional desktop and mobile applications?

Extended Reality adds the immersive feeling of interactions where our presence actually matters, and are not just bound to buttons.

### What use cases does XR have?

XR can benefit us in many different use cases, due to its flexibility and potential to simulate real life use cases while minimizing downsides. <br>
Examples of this can be found in the following areas:

- Gaming: 
```
Immersive worlds that give the player a more natural way to interact with its surroundings. 
```
- Media & Events: 
```
Movies, Immersive storytelling, virtual concerts or even a shared place for people to interact (like VRChat). 
```
- Education & Training:
```
Simulations can provide a good idea of how real life machines/concepts are applied, while also providing a safe environment that minimizes the risk of the "real thing" and gives the user the opportunity to retry. These can have the added benefit of unsupervised learning that allows the teaching to happen at the learners own pace, while providing all of the materials needed. Some examples could include the use of complex machinery or medical procedures.
```
- Marketing & Retail: 
```
AR applications could be used to show the user how certain products would look in their home, or VR could be used to take the user and place him in a world that simulates a product he is considering buying (cars, homes, etc).
```
- Remote help 
- Product Development & Art (ex Blender)
- Virtual tourism
- Architecture & Construction

#### How does XR add value to the end user?
XR has a few key elements that give value to the end user:

- Risk reduction (simulated environments usually have less consequences)
- Intuitive and interactive learning environment that can encourage a hands-on approach to learning
- Convenience & Accessibility (for some high stakes processes or in cases where the tools/resources are limited)
- Efficiency & Structure (instructions can be displayed in/next to the area of interest)
- Entertainment

### How does current XR technology compare to an idealistic future vision of the technology?
| Aspect | Today | Ideal Future |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ |
| Headsets | Bulky, heavy head‑mounted boxes (session use) | Light, glasses‑like, all‑day wearable |
| Visuals | Decent clarity, limited FOV, fixed focal plane | Near‑human sharpness, wide FOV, natural depth (varifocal/light field) |
| Interaction | Controllers + basic hand/eye tracking | Seamless multimodal: hands, eyes, voice, subtle gestures, rich haptics |
| World understanding | Tracks shapes; basic meshes | Rich, persistent, semantic shared spatial maps |
| Performance | Battery & heat constraints; compromises | Hybrid local + edge/cloud, smart foveated/neural rendering low latency |
| AR blending | Noisy, laggy passthrough; limited color accuracy | Photoreal, instant blending indistinguishable from real |
| Haptics | Simple vibration | Believable touch: force, texture, temperature |
| Ecosystem | Closed, fragmented platforms | Open standards, portable spatial content |
| Adoption | Expensive, niche | Affordable, mainstream |
| Trust | Data/privacy concerns | Strong on‑device processing & clear user control |

### How does immersion and presence factor into XR?
The more realistic and engaging the experience (immersion), the stronger the user's feeling of "being there" (presence). High presence makes XR more effective for learning, training, entertainment and empathy, while low presence, such as getting sick after a few hours of wearing the VR glasses, can break the illusion and reduce impact. Design choices in visuals, audio, interaction and feedback all influence these factors.

### How is input technology and interactions different in XR?

In a traditional virtual medium, inputs are abstracted into buttons, joysticks, keyboards, mice, or touchscreens. Complex actions like walking, opening a door, or eating can be reduced to a single button press or gesture. The physical motion is minimal as the computer interprets symbolic inputs. This breaks the immersion of interaction.

Thats why input technology in XR is trying to be as close to the real thing. As an example in the game minecraft to eat you press and hold a button and it just kind of happens. Meanwhile in the VR version of the same game its much more high fidelity as to eat you have to pick up food with hand tracking, moving it toward your face, triggering a “bite”.

### What problems can XR solve?

Besides offering more diverse entertainment, XR can solve diverse real-world problems.

It enables safer and more effective training in fields such as healthcare, aviation, and manufacturing by simulating complex or hazardous environments without real-world risks.

In education, XR creates immersive classrooms where students can explore abstract concepts or historical events as if they were physically present. And it can also make reading more interesting by overlaying a replica of what the person is studying about.

It also enhances remote collaboration, allowing people in different parts of the world to interact with 3D content in shared virtual spaces. Think of having a very good oil engineer across the world guide you hot to fix the oil rig.

In healthcare, XR supports therapy, rehabilitation, and pain management through controlled, engaging environments.
Additionally, it improves accessibility by offering virtual mobility options and adaptive interfaces for people with disabilities. Beyond this, XR helps architects, engineers, and designers rapidly prototype and visualize projects before physical production, saving both time and cost. Truly the posibilities are endless...

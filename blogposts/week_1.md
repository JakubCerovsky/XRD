# 1st Week Post

During the first lecture we were introduced to the concept of the classes, and shared our expectations. We have seen the course roadmap, projects related to XR, and received the list of expectations coming from the teacher (or as he called himself, the facilitator).

## Introduction to Extended Reality

#### What is AR/VR/AV/MR/XR and how do the terminologies compare?

Extended Reality (XR) is a superset of multiple terminologies:

**Augmented Reality (AR)**

- **Virtual Reality (VR)**

- **Augmented Virtuality (AV)**

- **Mixed Reality**

-

#### How do XR applications compare to traditional desktop and mobile applications?

Extended Reality adds the immersive feeling of interactions where our presence actually matters, and are not just bound to buttons.

#### What use cases does XR have?

The presence and immersion can serve as an opportunity for training purposes or some scenario simulations. This can be benefitial for safety reasons, or just as an increase in productivity.

#### How does XR add value to the end user?

#### How does current XR technology compare to an idealistic future vision of the technology?
| Aspect | Today | Ideal Future |
| ------ | ------ | ------------ |
| Headsets | Bulky, heavy head‑mounted boxes (session use) | Light, glasses‑like, all‑day wearable |
| Visuals | Decent clarity, limited FOV, fixed focal plane | Near‑human sharpness, wide FOV, natural depth (varifocal/light field) |
| Interaction | Controllers + basic hand/eye tracking | Seamless multimodal: hands, eyes, voice, subtle gestures, rich haptics |
| World understanding | Tracks shapes; basic meshes | Rich, persistent, semantic shared spatial maps |
| Performance | Battery & heat constraints; compromises | Hybrid local + edge/cloud, smart foveated/neural rendering low latency |
| AR blending | Noisy, laggy passthrough; limited color accuracy | Photoreal, instant blending indistinguishable from real |
| Haptics | Simple vibration | Believable touch: force, texture, temperature |
| Ecosystem | Closed, fragmented platforms | Open standards, portable spatial content |
| Adoption | Expensive, niche | Affordable, mainstream |
| Trust | Data/privacy concerns | Strong on‑device processing & clear user control |

#### How does immersion and presence factor into XR?
The more realistic and engaging the experience (immersion), the stronger the user's feeling of "being there" (presence). High presence makes XR more effective for learning, training, entertainment and empathy, while low presence, such as getting sick after a few hours of wearing the VR glasses, can break the illusion and reduce impact. Design choices in visuals, audio, interaction and feedback all influence these factors.

#### How is input technology and interactions different in XR?

#### What problems can XR solve?

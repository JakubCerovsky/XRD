# Library AR Navigator

This AR application helps you find a specific book in a school library. The system turns the traditional library experience into a smart, interactive, and user-friendly journey. This is achieved by using the immersive features the XR technologies provide, it not only makes the navigation faster but also enhance engagement and user satisfaction.

Below is a diagram explaining the flow of the application for user.

- Scan the book’s barcode/ISBN, instantly get the position and a shortest route back to its exact bay.
